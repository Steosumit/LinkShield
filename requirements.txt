# GPU-accelerated libraries (RECOMMENDED for better performance)
xgboost  # Supports GPU acceleration with device='cuda'
lightgbm  # Supports GPU acceleration with device='gpu'

# CuML/RAPIDS (OPTIONAL - Advanced GPU acceleration)
# WARNING: CuML installation on Windows is complex and often fails
# XGBoost and LightGBM GPU support is sufficient for most use cases
# Only attempt CuML installation if you specifically need it:
#
# For Linux with CUDA 11:
#   pip install cuml-cu11 cupy-cuda11x
# For Linux with CUDA 12:
#   pip install cuml-cu12 cupy-cuda12x
#
# Note: CuML is NOT required for GPU training.
#       XGBoost and LightGBM will provide excellent GPU acceleration!
